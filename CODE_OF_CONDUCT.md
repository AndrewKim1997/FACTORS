# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

In the FACTORS project we aspire to build an open, welcoming, and supportive research community. Everyone who participates in this repository, its issue tracker, pull requests, discussions, and related channels is expected to treat others with respect and courtesy.

## Expected behavior

* Be respectful and considerate in all communications.
* Assume good faith and provide constructive, solution-oriented feedback.
* Use inclusive language and avoid expressions that may exclude or demean others.
* Give credit where it is due and be transparent about contributions and sources.
* Follow repository guidelines for contributions, testing, and documentation.

## Unacceptable behavior

The following behaviors are unacceptable and may lead to corrective action:

* Harassment, intimidation, or hateful speech of any kind.
* Personal attacks, insults, or persistent unwelcome criticism.
* Discriminatory language or behavior based on age, race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, nationality, or other protected characteristic.
* Threats of violence, stalking, or any actions that put participants at risk.
* Public shaming, doxxing, or sharing private information without consent.
* Repeatedly ignoring maintainersâ€™ or community norms after warnings.
* Posting abusive, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive content in repository issues, PRs, or attachments.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the FACTORS project, including:

* GitHub repository issues, pull requests, and comments
* Code review discussions and commit messages
* Mail lists and project chat channels that are explicitly linked from the repository README
* In-person or virtual events organized by the project

## Reporting an incident

If you experience or witness a violation of this Code of Conduct, please report it to the project maintainers as soon as possible. To report:

1. Open an issue using the template `issue_template/conduct.md` if available, and set its visibility to private if the platform supports it; or
2. Contact the maintainers directly (see the `MAINTAINERS` file in the repository) and provide:

   * A clear description of the incident
   * Links to relevant comments, PRs, or issues
   * The usernames of involved parties
   * Any supporting logs or screenshots
   * Your preferred confidentiality level and contact method

If you cannot or prefer not to use GitHub to report, indicate an alternative contact in the `MAINTAINERS` file or ask a maintainer to provide a secure reporting channel.

## Enforcement

Maintainers will handle reports promptly and fairly. The enforcement process may include:

* Acknowledgment of receipt and an initial timeline for response
* Confidential review of the report and any relevant materials
* Requesting clarification or additional information from reporter(s) if needed
* Private communication with involved parties to understand circumstances
* Actions taken when a violation is confirmed, which may include:

  * A private warning and request to change behavior
  * Temporary or permanent blocking from interacting with the repository
  * Reverting or removing offending content
  * Notifying relevant institutions if behavior breaches legal or institutional policies

Maintainers will aim to protect reporters from retaliation. Confidentiality will be preserved to the extent possible while allowing a fair investigation.

## Consequences

Consequences are proportional to the severity and frequency of the violation. Repeat offenders may be permanently banned from contributing; serious or illegal actions may be escalated to appropriate authorities or institutions.

## Appeals

If you are subject to a disciplinary action and believe it was unjust, you may submit an appeal to the maintainers. Appeals should include new evidence or context. The maintainers or designated impartial reviewers will consider appeals and respond in a timely manner.

## A note to maintainers and contributors

Maintainers should:

* Lead by example and enforce this Code of Conduct consistently.
* Be mindful of power dynamics when interacting with new contributors.
* Maintain and publish a clear, accessible process for reporting and resolving incidents.

Contributors should:

* Familiarize themselves with the Code of Conduct before contributing.
* Raise concerns about behavior in a timely and factual manner.

## License and attribution

This Code of Conduct is provided as the FACTORS project policy. Where appropriate, it may be adapted from widely used community templates for clarity and brevity.

---

If you would like, I can:

* generate a private `issue_template/conduct.md` to standardize reports,
* produce a `MAINTAINERS` file skeleton with placeholder contact points,
* or create a short CONTRIBUTOR-facing summary badge and link to embed in the README. Which would you prefer next?
