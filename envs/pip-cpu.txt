# pip CPU requirements for FACTORS
# - These are the Python packages installed via pip inside CPU environments
# - This file is referenced by envs/conda-cpu.yml and docker/Dockerfile.cpu
# - For CPU-only PyTorch wheels follow PyTorch official instructions; we leave torch out here by default

scipy>=1.10
pandas>=1.5
scikit-learn>=1.2
pyyaml>=6.0
tqdm>=4.64

# Optional: if you want to install CPU-only PyTorch from pip, uncomment and use the correct wheel for your platform.
# Example (commented): pip install torch==2.1.0+cpu torchvision==0.16.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
# We recommend following the official PyTorch instructions to pick the appropriate wheel for your platform.
