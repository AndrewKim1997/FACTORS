# pip GPU requirements for FACTORS
# - This file is referenced by envs/conda-gpu.yml and docker/Dockerfile.gpu
# - It contains common Python packages. For PyTorch + CUDA, prefer installing an explicit wheel
#   that matches your host CUDA driver. Example install commands are provided as comments.
numpy>=1.24
scipy>=1.10
pandas>=1.5
scikit-learn>=1.2
pyyaml>=6.0
tqdm>=4.64
joblib>=1.2
matplotlib>=3.6
seaborn>=0.12
requests>=2.28
shap>=0.41

# PyTorch with CUDA: install the appropriate wheel for your CUDA version.
# Example for CUDA 11.8 (replace version numbers with the desired ones):
# pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 torch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0
#
# Or using the general stable wheel index (PyTorch provides platform-specific instructions):
# pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
#
# NOTE: We do not pin a +cu suffix in this file because CUDA wheel selection depends on the host GPU drivers.
# Choose and install the correct torch wheel before running GPU experiments.
